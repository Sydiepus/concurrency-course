| Clients | Average latency (ms) | CPU Usage |
|---------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1       | 118                  | 208%      |
|5|327.8|143%|
|50|2664.38|33%|

The more clients use the server the higher the latency, the CPU usage drops because the server is not doing any work during the wait time.
